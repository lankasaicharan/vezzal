Tool name: Magic
Case number: #3
Description: 
This is a test case where the spice extraction with parasitics is tested and the output is compared with already existing result. The tricky part here is the order of capacitors is not the same for everytime you do extraction. So, it needs to be modified a little bit for comparision of nodes and values.
Result expected: Success
